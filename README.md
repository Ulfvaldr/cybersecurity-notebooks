## **Notebooks**

### 1. Network Scanning with Nmap
- [Nmap Scan Analysis](nmap/nmap_scan_analysis.ipynb): A tutorial on how to perform a full network scan using Nmap and analyze the results.
- [Visualizing Nmap Scans](nmap/nmap_network_scan_visualization.ipynb): Learn how to visualize Nmap scan data using Python libraries like Pandas and Seaborn.

### 2. Vulnerability Analysis with Nmap and Vulners
- [Nmap + Vulners Vulnerability Scan](vulnerability-analysis/nmap_vulners_scan.ipynb): A guide to performing vulnerability analysis by combining Nmap with the Vulners API. Generate detailed vulnerability reports, including CVSS scores and severity levels.
- [Visualizing Vulnerabilities](vulnerability-analysis_vulners_visualization.ipynb): Visualize vulnerability data, including severity levels and the distribution of CVSS scores, using Python libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn.

### 3. **MITRE ATT&CK Threat Detection**
- [MITRE ATT&CK Framework Analysis](mitre-threat-detection/automated_threat_detection_with_mitre_attack.ipynb): Detect threats and map events to the MITRE ATT&CK framework. Learn how to retrieve tactics and techniques and generate comprehensive reports.
- [Heatmap and Matrix Visualization](link_to_notebook): Generate visualizations like heatmaps and ATT&CK matrices to showcase detected threats.
